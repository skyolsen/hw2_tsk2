"""
Make sure you make this module as modular as you can.
That is add as many functions as you can.
1) Have a main function
2) A function to capture user input, this could be inside your "main" function
3) A function to calculate the projectile motion
4) A function to display the graph

Make sure you use docstring to document your module and all
your functions.

Make sure your python module works in dual-mode: by itself or import to other module
